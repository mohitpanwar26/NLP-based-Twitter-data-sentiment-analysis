* Twitter Sentiment Analysis with BERT and roBERTa transformers

This project is about the analysis of tweets about coronavirus, with the goal of performing a Sentiment Analysis using BERT and roBERTa algorithms to predict the emotion of a tweet (Positive, Negative or Neutral). In particular, both BERT and ROBERTA will be fine tuned using the given dataset in order to improve the model overall performance.
Before feeding the data to the algorithms, the tweets will be deeply cleaned to remove links, hashtags at the end of the sentences and punctuation to allow the algorithms to better understand the text and improve the prediction performance.
